This directory contains some helper Python scripts for reading, parsing and
writing (eventually) the various .db files that MUX writes. Currently, there
is:

flatfiledb.py		Reads and parses the main 'MUXample.db' file
hcodedb.py		Reads and parses the 'hcode.db' file

All scripts can be imported as modules, see their docstrings for usage. They
can also be executed as scripts, though they only load up the respective .db
file into a database called 'db' and then exit; you can use python's "-i" to
keep the interpreter running after that:

python -i flatfiledb.py ../game/data/MUXample.db
python -i hcodedb.py ../game/data/hcode.db
