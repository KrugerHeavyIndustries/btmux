/*************************************************************
****  LOS code  **********************************************
**************************************************************

What happens in the code now:
(pretty close, anyway -- I haven't spent THAT much time studying it.

Right now, the code just finds a line between the hexes and steps
along it in units of 1 hex, checking each hex it enters.  This is,
well, wrong.  It makes no allowance whatsoever that the LOS line might
"clip" the edge of a hex, and will occasionally skip hexes:
 __    __    __
/# \__/  \__/# \
\__/  \__/  \__/  is possible, when it SHOULD be:
 __    __    __
/# \__/  \__/# \  A 1 hex wide wall in the first case would be
\__/  \__/  \__/  skipped entirely.
   \__/  \__/   

Now my, (correct, but tougher) algorithm:

OK, first FASA rules: "The LOS is checked by laying a straightedge
... from the center of the attackers's hex to the center of the
target's hex.  Any hex that the straightedge crosses is in the LOS.
If the straightedge passes directly between two hexes, the defender
chooses which hex ist passes through." -- Compendium, p21

It is fairly easy to convince yourself that the case of the line lying
directly between two hexes is a well-defined special case: it happens
only when the hexes lie exactly on a 30, 90, 150, 210, 270, or 330
line.  This is easy to check for, so we'll put that check in as the
first stage of the routine.  We'll assume from then on that the line
is not a special case  (which is good -- the numbers explode to
infinity for 90 degree lines).

Now we iterate as the current muse code does.  We start at the hex at
one end of the line, find the next one, and repeat until we get to the
end.  Here is the algorithm for finding the "next" hex:

First, we need only check the 6 adjacent hexes (obviously -- but the
current code ignores this and sometimes returns "next" hexes that are
not adjacent).

In addition, an eligible hex muse be "on the line."  That is, the
imaginary line drawn between the endpoints must pass through the hex.
Figuring this out is the "meat" of this algorithm.  The best way to
determine this (that I have discovered, anyway) is to find the
(absolute, cartesian, floating point) distance between the center
point of the hex in question and the line (i.e. the length of a line
drawn from the center of hex, perpendicular to the LOS line). If this
distance is less than the "effective radius" of the hex, then the line
lies inside the hex.  By "effective radius" I mean the width of the
hex along a line perpendicular to the LOS line.  This will vary
(depending on the angle of the line) between 0.5 (if the hex is lying
flat along the line -- i.e. a line pointing at 30, 90, 150, 210, 270,
or 330 degrees) and (1/sqrt(3)) (if the line passes only through the
point of the hex -- i.e. a line pointing at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, or
300)

  _Effective_Radius_
  _____        _____
 /     \ |    /     \   /     (Hope this diagram makes sense!
/       \|   /   *_  \ /       the *'s are the line representing
\       /|   \     * //        the effective radius)
 \_____/ |    \_____// 
    *****|          /

(1/sqrt(3))     0.5

For other angles, the effective radius varies as a cosine.  Since the
whole thing is periodic with intervals of 60 deg, we can "modulo" it
by subtracting 60 deg until we get the angle to within a -30 < angle <
30 degrees region and then taking the cosine.

Hoof!  That's the worst of it.  Now, from among the adjacent, eligible
hexes, the "next" one is the one that is closest "along the line" to
the one we are in. (But is still closer to the endpoint than the
current hex.  We have to check here to make sure we don't hop back
into the hex we came from!)

Now performance issues:

The main calculations here are the distance-to-line determination, and
the effective radius calculation.  Each of these must be performed 5
times (6 adjacent hexes, but we don't have to check the one we came
from).  Distance-to-line is best found by using a matrix to rotate the
coordinates to a frame where the line is horizontal and taking the
difference in y coords between the hex and any point on the line (one
of the endpoints will do).  The angle to rotate is -(slope of the LOS
line), which is -atan(y1-y2/x1-x2).  The atan function need only be
called once, since the slope of the line is unchanging.  That leaves
us with the matrix:   |cos(u) -sin(u)|
                      |sin(u)  cos(u)|   where u=-atan(y1-y2/x1-x2)

This contains four more trigonometric functions, but again each need
only be called once (and there are really only two anyway, sin(u) and
cos(u)).

The effective radius involves a cos() function.  Again, though, since
the slope of the line is unchanging, the effective radius of the hex
is a constant throughout the iterations, and need only be calculated
once.

So now we have one time costs:

*Calculate matrix coefficients:  1 atan(), 1 cos(), 1 sin()
                                 2 fp subtractions, 1 fp divide.

*Find effective radius:          1 cos(),
                                <6 fp subtractions (to get -30<u<30)

And per-hex-travelled costs:

*Test 5 hexes if on line:       10 fp mults, 5 fp additions
                                 5 fp compares

*Test for closest forward hex:  <5 fp compares

This is actually, I would think, not much more than the current LOS
code, which makes many calls to RealCoordToMapCoord() (a costly
function) and is generally messy, with lots of repeated mults by
constants such as ZSCALE (which would optimize out, if we did, but we
don't :)
