btonline-btechmux 0.2:
    - Bugfixes
        * Fixed ArtemisV's abbreviation to be AV rather than AIV which
	  is already taken (Greg Taylor)
	* Changed the version string to be a little shorter. (Greg Taylor)
	* Removed BT_COMPLEXREPAIRS from defines. Most sites won't
	  want such granular parts, see btconfig.h if you are curious
	  and want per-tonnage actuators and assorted parts.
	* Also removed BT_FREETECHTIME from the default compile
	  flags. This allows for instant repairs which again, most sites
	  probably won't use. (Greg Taylor)

btonline-btechmux 0.1:
    Extensive revisions/additions. See docs/exilemerge.txt for details.

btechmux 1.4.3:
    - New Features
	* Rocket Launchers from FM: Periphery (Cord)
	* HUDINFO version 0.6 (optional, default on) (Focus)
	* Part weight (optional, configure in btconfig.h) (Greg Taylor)
	* New connect.txt's for the MUXample DB (Greg Taylor, Focus)
	* Variable Recycle Time (optional, configure in btconfig.h) (Cord)
	* New Stagger code: stagger only once a turn (Focus)
	* add Clan MicroPulseLaser weapon from BMR (Focus)
	* Rework 'status short' to show more useful info (NC, Focus)
	* Fusion VTOLs no longer need fuel (Cord)
	* Add 'None' to argument for 'settype' (Greg Taylor)
	* @log and logf() to log to arbitrary files in the 'log'
	  directory (optional in config.h, default on) (Kevin Stevens)
	* Rework hcode.db loading code so XCODE structs are growable,
	  reducing the need for hcode.db wipes in the future (Focus)
	* 'enterbay' command to AUTOPILOTs, in both radio-controlled
	  and programmed modes. (Focus)
	* Use building or dropship hangar's @FAIL attribute as 'failure'
	  message when trying to enter a base or bay (Focus)
	* MechWarrior Companion advantages (Bloodname, Combat_Sense,
	  Contact, Dropship and EI_Implant) and skills (Drive-Naval,
	  Piloting-Battlesuit, Riding, Technician-Battlesuit,
	  Technician-Spacecraft and Zero-G_Operations.)
	  Piloting-Battlesuit differs from Piloting-BSuit in that it is an
	  Atheltic skill, rather than a Physical one, and also in that it
	  isn't used in actual code yet. (Focus)
	
    - Bugfixes
	* Rewrite (template) weight calculation code to be more correct for
	  both 'mechs and tanks. The main impact is on tanks, however, as
	  the weight calculation for those was very wrong. Also fix many
	  templates to comply to the new rules. (Focus)
	* Rewrite weapon weight calculation so Long Toms and Clan
	  MachineGuns have their actual weight. (Focus)
	* Lots of C3/C3i fixes (Cord)
	* Lots of Battlesuit fixes (Cord)
	* Report the correct 'mech on MechXP when fixing, removing or
	  replacing guns (Cord & Focus at the same time)
	* Use the correct cargo type when repairing Compact, Light and XXL
	  Engines (Focus)
	* Fix (very old) comparison between pointer and integer that had
	  potential to crash the MUX when using Extended Range. (Focus)
	* Fix weight of IS Ultra AC/2 (was 6, should be 7 tons) (Focus)
	* Prevent Death-XP-removal code from handing out XP if the
	  btech_xploss config setting is too high (Focus)
	* Ignore whitespace in config file rather than complaining about
	  'unknown directives' (Focus)
	* Robustify mkindx to deal with long lines (Focus)
	* Take Pilot skills into account when doing BV calculations for XP
	  gain (Cord, bug found by Marcus Hazen@3030)
	* Prevent jumping 'mechs from being picked up (Cord)
	* Disallow enterbase until unit speed is close to 0 kph,
	  not 10.75 kph (1MP) (Cord)
	* Sanitized weapon-arc handling, giving tanks and 'mechs the
	  same (FASA) weapon arcs (Focus)
	* Fix tank 'ammoboom' critical hits (Cord)
	* Fix 'stores' and 'manifest' to show '1k' (or higher) rather than
	  always 999 for values over 999 (Focus)
	* Lots of removal of dead code (Focus)
	* Lots of code cleanup (Cord, Focus, NC)

btechmux 1.4.2:
    - New features
	* Add compile-time setting (DO_PARSE_WIZNEWS) to enable %-parsing of
	  the 'wiznews' file. (Greg Taylor & Focus, SF patch #500268)
	* Allow 'who' and 'last' on channels that you currently do not have
	  'on', if you are a Wizard or the @admin allow_chanlurking is on
	  (defaults to off) (Focus)
	* Allow 'setteam' to set the team num to any int, rather than up to
	  and including 26. (Focus)
	* Add 'b' (for BattleSuits) as argument to 'settype'
	  (Greg Taylor, SF patch #500269)
	* Add a number of maps from Greg Taylor (SF patch #500071)
	* Reworked build mechanism so GDBM is no longer needed. dbconvert is
	  not built by default now; use regular TinyMUX dbconvert if you
	  need it. (Focus)
	* Add player-customizable tactical/navigate/lrs colors, using
	  the MAPCOLOR attribute. (Focus)
	* Allow 'repairs' and 'damages' commands outside of stalls if
	  btech_limitedrepairs is false. (Cord)

    - Bugfixes
	* Fix a longstanding crashing bug in regmatch() (Focus & Null)
	* Fix crashing bug in AUTOPILOTs if any are 'active' during
	  @restart/startup. (Focus)
	* Big overhaul on the comsystem, removing numerous crashing bugs
	  without introducing too many new ones (hopefully) (Focus)
	* Fix a few of the checks in configure so crypt() is properly
	  detected. (Focus)
	* Fix buglet in @mechstatus support that caused armor/internal
	  numbers to always show up in highlighted-black, even if the
	  section was destroyed. (Focus)
	* Fix SF bug #500646: spurious DAMAGED weaponstatus for large
	  (multi-crit) weapons in vehicles. (Focus)
	* Set speed of dropped-off units to 0 (NC)
	* Plug buffer-overrun in 'loadnew' command and a few others that
	  use it. (Focus)
	* Fix spurious warnings about empty lines in the MUX .conf file.
	  (Focus)
	* Fix SF bug #502112, the sizes of Aerodyne and Spheroid dropships
	  for hexlos-tracing were swapped. (Focus & Null)
	* Fix bug where a tank driving off a cliff into water wouldn't get
	  auto-killed (missing water checks.) (Cord)
	* Fix weapon destruction for 'damaged' weapons. (Cord)
	* Add missing '<item> destroyed!' messages for damaged items;
	  this could cause CRITICAL HIT!! messages without saying what was
	  critically hit. (Cord)
	* General code cleanup and removal of dead code (NC, Focus)

btechmux 1.4.1:
	* Re-package slightly differently, to avoid broken downloads
	* Mark the game/data/ files as 'binary' in CVS, as they are
	* Add CodingStyle document
	* Guard against possible 'out of map' problem in artillery (NC)
	* Make @mechstatus (custom 'status' template settable from scode) 
	  working again. (Focus)
	* Fix bug in 'status' where ')' in the 'status' template script was
	  incorrectly handled. (Focus)
	* Make the MechPer() (perception modifier) value of a 'mech visible
	  and changeable from scode. (Focus)
